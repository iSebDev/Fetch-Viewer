# Fetch-Viewer
Simple Data Request site.

# Intentions
Fetch Viewer is a free software made just for fun, not for profit, not wanting to make it a big project, I did it to be able to receive the API data like images, JSON, etc.

# Simple Use
>It is easy to use, accessible, free and with all the comforts with its UI.
>Opening the "index.html" with the browser you can enter the Fetch Viewer menu
